# english conditional

虚拟语气

## first conditional

 we are thinking about a particular condition in the present or future, and the result of this condition. there is a `real possibility` that is condition will happen

`if` & `unless` == if not

if/unless + simple present, subject + will + verb

## second conditional

we use if with the `past simple` tense (to introduce the condition), and `would` + the infinitive(to show the consequence) when we want to show that a situation is unreal or unlikely.

it is also possible to use `could`(for posibility and ability) or `might`(for uncertainty) in place of would (for certainty)
